/* 
    * To declare a variable in JavaScript we use either the keyword "var", or the keyword "let"
    * The usual convention for variable names is camelCase (first letter lowercase and all the subsequent uppercase)
    ! Variable names CANNOT start with number
    ! Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores or dollar signs
    ! Variable names CANNOT be reserved keywords (avoid "name" as well)
    ! Variable names should not be started with an uppercase letter
    * Constants (variables that won't have its value changed) are named with an uppercase
    * Variable names should be descriptive, that is, you should know right away what value are they storing

    1. Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).
